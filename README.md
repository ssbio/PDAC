# PDAC Metabolic Modeling & Biomarker Discovery Repository

## Overview
This repository contains computational tools and metabolic models developed for the study *"GAN-Enhanced Machine Learning and Metabolic Modeling Identify Reprogramming Signatures and Vulnerabilities in Pancreatic Cancer"*. The framework integrates:

- Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMs) of 144 PDAC and 144 healthy samples
- WGAN-GP synthetic healthy data generation with biological validation
- Random Forest classifier for PDAC metabolic signature identification
- Multi-level analysis of pathway, reaction, and gene alterations
